"Electric","*BSD, Java","GPL","Yes","VLSI circuit design tool with connectivity at all levels. Can also be used for schematic entry and PCB design."
"FreePCB","w32","GPL","Yes","A printed circuit board design program for Microsoft Windows. FreePCB allows for up to 16 copper layers, both metric and English units, and export of designs in Gerber format. Boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the FreeRouting autorouter by using the FpcROUTE Specctra DSN file translator."

"Icarus Verilog","*BSD, Linux, Mac","GPL","","Verilog simulator"
"KiCad","*BSD, Windows, Linux, Mac","GNU GPL","Built-in, or FreeRouting","Full package for schematic and board design, etc. Design rule checking. User-defined symbols and footprints. Gerber/ drill file creation. Sophisticated graphic interface. Active user community."
"KTechLab","Linux","GPL","n/a","KTechLab is a schematic capture and simulator. It is specifically geared toward mixed signal simulation of analog components and small digital processors."
"Magic","Linux","BSD license","no","A popular very-large-scale integration layout tool"
"Oregano","","GPL","no","Schematic capture + spice simulation"
"Quite Universal Circuit Simulator","Linux, Solaris, Mac, NetBSD, FreeBSD, w32","GPL","","Schematic capture + Verilog + VHDL + simulation"
"Verilator","Posix","GPL","","Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator. It compiles synthesizable Verilog into cycle accurate C++ or SystemC code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. Benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as ModelSim, NC-Verilog and VCS, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as Carbon ModelStudio and ARC VTOC."
"XCircuit","Unix","GPL","","Used to produce netlists and publish high-quality drawings."
