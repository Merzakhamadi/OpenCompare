"Signal quality/coverage area","Good coverage due to low frequencies","Good coverage indoors on 850/900 MHz. Repeaters possible. 35 km hard limit.","Smaller cells and lower indoors coverage on 2100 MHz; equivalent coverage indoors and superior range to GSM on 850/900 MHz.","Unlimited cell size, low transmitter power permits large cells","Unlimited cell size, low transmitter power permits large cells",""
"Frequency utilization/Call density","Very low density","0.2 MHz = 8 timeslots. Each timeslot can hold up to 2 calls (4 calls with VAMOS) through interleaving.","5 MHz = 2 Mbit/s. 42Mbit/s for HSPA+.
