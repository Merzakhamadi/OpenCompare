"Arrays are implicitly direct specializations of Object. They are not unified with collection types.","Arrays in C# are implicit specializations of the System.Array class that implements a number of collection interfaces."
"Arrays and collections are completely separate with no unification. Arrays cannot be passed where sequences or collections are expected","Arrays can be passed where sequences (IEnumerables) or collections/list interfaces are expected. However, the collection operations that alter the number of elements (insert/add/remove) will throw exceptions as these operations are not supported by arrays."
"The for statement accepts either arrays or Iterables. All collections implement Iterable. This means that the same short syntax can be used in for-loops.","The foreach statement iterates through a sequence using the IEnumerable orIEnumerableT interface. Because arrays always implicitly implement these interfaces, the loop will iterate through arrays as well."
"In both languages arrays are covariant. This means that a String[] array is assignable to variables of Object[] because String is a specialization of (assignable to) Object. In both languages the arrays will perform a type check when inserting new values because type-safety would otherwise be compromised. This is in contrast to how generic collections have been implemented in both languages.","In both languages arrays are covariant.

"No multidimensional arrays (rectangular arrays), but arrays of references to arrays (jagged array).","Multidimensional arrays (rectangular arrays), as well as arrays of references to arrays (jagged array)."
"Arrays cannot be resized (though use of the System.arraycopy() method can allow for multi-step array resizing)","Arrays can be resized while preserving existing values using the Array.Resize() static array method."
"Implemented as a retrofit for the java.util library having extra features, like data structures like sets and linked sets, and has a number of algorithms to manipulate elements of a collection, like finding the largest element based on some Comparator object, finding the smallest element, finding sublists within a list, reverse the contents of a list, shuffle the contents of a list, create immutable versions of a collection, performs sorts, and make binary searches.","The C# collections framework consists of classes from the System.Collections and the System.Collections.Generic namespaces with a number of useful interfaces, abstract classes, and data structures. Net 3.5 added System.Linq namespace contains various extension methods for querying collections, such as Join, Union, Distinct, All, Average, Aggregate and many others. Queries using these methods are called LINQ queries."
